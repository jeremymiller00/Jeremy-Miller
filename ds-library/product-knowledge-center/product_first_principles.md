# Product Management First Principles
## Things We Can Always Do to Develop Product Experience
* Ensure the team has something worth building 
* Make sure the customer problem is the data problem 
* Spend time with your customers, understand their problems
* Measure and optimize the impact of the team's efforts 
* Outcomes over outputs 
 * An outcome is a change in human behavior which drives business value 
 * An outcome should be more-or-less a Key Result 
* The Product should determine the metrics, not the other way around 
* Write, to clarify your thinking. Create your vision
* Convince leadership to invest time and resources in the the idea / vision
* Ensure solution is valuable (customer would buy / use it)
* Ensure solution is viable (it works for the company)
* Ensure solution is usable (with designers)
* Ensure solution is feasible (with engineers)
* Deliver: remember, the goal is not to ship a product, but to solve the customer's problem
* Repeat
